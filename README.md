Orders, Delivery & Customer Insights Analysis using SQL

Project Objective
This project analyzes a 50,000+ records dataset of customer orders to understand revenue trends, delivery performance, customer behavior, payment patterns, and feedback sentiment using SQL in MySQL Workbench.
 Tools Used
•	MySQL Workbench
•	SQL
•	Excel (for review)
 Dataset Includes
•	Order details
•	Customer information
•	Delivery timings and distance
•	Payment methods
•	Profit data
•	Customer ratings and feedback sentiment
 Analysis Performed
•	Revenue and profit analysis
•	Delivery delay vs distance analysis
•	Customer segmentation analysis
•	Payment method performance
•	Feedback sentiment vs delivery status
•	Area and pincode business performance
 Key Insights
•	Longer delivery distances were strongly associated with delayed deliveries and lower customer ratings.
•	Certain areas generated high revenue but also showed frequent delivery delays.
•	Customers using specific payment methods showed higher average order values.
•	Negative feedback sentiment was mostly linked to delayed deliveries.
•	A small group of customers contributed to a large portion of total revenue (high-value customers).
✅ Outcome
This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL data analysis from raw data cleaning to business insight generation.
